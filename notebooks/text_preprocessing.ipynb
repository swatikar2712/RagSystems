If, as a seller, you do \\nnot want your item to be sold to buyers internationally, you can exclude countries or regions you \\ndon\\'t want to ship to by adjusting your shipping settings as provided in the International selling \\npolicy. Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to \\nthe international sale, purchase, and shipment of items. \\nIf you purchase an item on an eBay site that is different from your registration site, you are subject to \\nthe User Agreement and applicable policies of that other eBay site with respect to that particular \\npurchase, as detailed in the International selling policy. \\nFor sellers, you agree that we may display your listing for sale on an eBay site other than the site \\nwhere you listed your item for sale, based on your shipping settings. You may adjust these settings as \\ndetailed in the International selling policy.

It is facilitated by eBay through third-party service \\nproviders that eBay has contracted with to operationalize the program.

Informal Dispute Resolution \\nIf a Dispute arises between you and eBay, eBay is committed to working with you to reach a \\nprompt, low-cost and mutually reasonable resolution. You and eBay agree to participate in \\ngood faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes before starting an arbitration or initiating an \\naction in small claims court (\"Informal Dispute Resolution\"). To initiate Informal Dispute \\nResolution, a party must give notice to the other party in writing in a valid Notice of Dispute \\n(\"Notice\"), which may be downloaded at this link. Such Notice to eBay should be sent by \\nemail to DisputeNotice@eBay.com or regular mail to our offices located at 583 W. eBay Way, \\nDraper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file \\nassociated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up \\nto date. To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the \\nNotice form, including a description of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought, \\nand the user name, email address and phone number associated with your account. \\nThe Informal Dispute Resolution process lasts 45 days and is a mandatory precondition to \\ncommencing arbitration.

Waiver of Jury Trial \\nYOU AND EBAY HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN \\nCOURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY .

All other Disputes, aside from those explicitly exempted in \\nSections 19.B (above), shall be arbitrated. This section does not prevent you or eBay from \\nparticipating in a class-wide settlement of claims. \\n4. Arbitration Procedures \\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator \\ninstead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, \\nan arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court \\ncan award to an individual. An arbitrator will apply the terms of the User Agreement as a \\ncourt would. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, \\nwithout limitation, disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the Agreement to \\nArbitrate, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Agreement to \\nArbitrate or any portion of the Agreement to Arbitrate, except that all Disputes regarding \\nSection 19.B.3 (\"Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief\") including any claim \\nthat all or part of that Section is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section \\nhas been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an \\narbitrator. \\nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Unsatisfied judgments on \\nthe arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This User Agreement \\nevidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other \\nprovision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 \\nU.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to \\nArbitrate and any arbitration, including the procedures governing Batch Arbitration. \\nIf Informal Dispute Resolution does not resolve satisfactorily within 45 days after receipt of a \\nNotice, you and eBay agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute \\nthrough binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration & \\nMediation (\"NAM\") in accordance with the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules \\nand Procedure (the \"NAM Comprehensive Rules\") in effect at the time of arbitration, except \\nas supplemented, where applicable, by the NAM Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration \\nFilings (the \"NAM Mass Filing Rules\"; together with the NAM Comprehensive Rules, the \\n\"NAM Rules\"), and as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The NAM Rules are currently \\navailable at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/. If NAM is unavailable to \\nadminister the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or, if the \\nparties cannot reach agreement, the court (pursuant to Section 19.C below) shall select the \\nadministrator. \\nA party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a demand for \\narbitration (the \"Demand\"). A Demand to eBay should be sent by mail to eBay Inc., Attn: \\nLitigation Department, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. If eBay initiates an arbitration \\nagainst you, it will send a Demand to the physical address we have on file associated with \\nyour eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. A \\nDemand form is available on NAM\\'s site at \\nhttps://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2024/09/Revised-Comprehensive-Demand-for-\\nArb-9.17.24.pdf.

NAM shall administer all batches concurrently, to the extent \\npossible. \\nAll parties agree that Demands are of a \"substantially similar nature\" if they arise out of or \\nrelate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issue(s) and \\nseek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the \\nBatch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise NAM, and NAM shall appoint a \\nsole standing Procedural Arbitrator or, should the circumstances so require, an Emergency \\nArbitrator, according to the NAM Rules, to determine the applicability of the Batch \\nArbitration process (the Procedural Arbitrator or Emergency Arbitrator, the \"Administrative \\nArbitrator\"). To expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the \\nparties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to \\nresolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by eBay. \\nYou and eBay agree to cooperate in good faith with NAM to implement the Batch Arbitration \\nprocess including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of \\nDemands, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may \\ninclude: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the \\nresolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the \\narbitration proceedings. This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as \\nauthorizing a class, collective and/or representative arbitration or action of any kind, except \\nas expressly set forth in this provision, and nothing about the Batch Arbitration process will \\npreclude any party from participating in any arbitration administered according to that \\nprocess. \\n8.
