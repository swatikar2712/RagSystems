  "You and eBay each agree that any and all disputes or claims between you and eBay (or any related \nthird parties) that arise out of or relate in any way to this or previous versions of the User \nAgreement, your use of or access to our Services, the actions of eBay or its agents, or any products",
  "or services sold, offered, or purchased through our Services, including the scope or applicability of \nthis Agreement to Arbitrate (each, a \"Dispute\") shall be resolved exclusively through final and",
  "binding arbitration, rather than in court. The exceptions to this Agreement to Arbitrate are: (1) you or \neBay may seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and",
  "(2) you or eBay may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual \nproperty rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and",
  "patents). For purposes of this Agreement to Arbitrate, \"Dispute\" will also include disputes that arose \nor involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of the User Agreement as",
  "well as claims that may arise after the termination of this User Agreement, unless those disputes \nwere noticed prior to this User Agreement. \n1. Informal Dispute Resolution \nIf a Dispute arises between you and eBay, eBay is committed to working with you to reach a",
  "prompt, low-cost and mutually reasonable resolution. You and eBay agree to participate in \ngood faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes before starting an arbitration or initiating an \naction in small claims court (\"Informal Dispute Resolution\"). To initiate Informal Dispute",
  "Resolution, a party must give notice to the other party in writing in a valid Notice of Dispute \n(\"Notice\"), which may be downloaded at this link. Such Notice to eBay should be sent by \nemail to DisputeNotice@eBay.com or regular mail to our offices located at 583 W. eBay Way,",
  "Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file \nassociated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up \nto date. To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the",
  "Notice form, including a description of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought, \nand the user name, email address and phone number associated with your account. \nThe Informal Dispute Resolution process lasts 45 days and is a mandatory precondition to",
  "commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing deadlines shall be tolled \nwhile the parties engage in Informal Dispute Resolution. \n2. Waiver of Jury Trial \nYOU AND EBAY HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN",
  "COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY . You and eBay are instead \nelecting that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Agreement to Arbitrate, \nexcept as specified in Section 19.B (\"Agreement to Arbitrate\").",
  "3. Waiver of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief \nEACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND \nNOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE",
  "ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR \nARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF \nIS AVAILABLE. Subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate, the arbitrator may award declaratory",
  "or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent \nnecessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this \nparagraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.B.7",
  "(\"Batch Arbitration\"). \nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement to Arbitrate, if a final decision, \nnot subject to any further appeal or recourse, determines that the limitations of this Section",
  "are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request \nfor public injunctive relief), you and eBay agree that that particular claim or request for relief \n(and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and",
  "may be brought in court (pursuant to Section 19.C below), subject to your and eBay's right to \nappeal the court's decision. All other Disputes, aside from those explicitly exempted in \nSections 19.B (above), shall be arbitrated. This section does not prevent you or eBay from",
  "participating in a class-wide settlement of claims. \n4. Arbitration Procedures \nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator \ninstead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However,",
  "an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court \ncan award to an individual. An arbitrator will apply the terms of the User Agreement as a \ncourt would. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including,",
  "without limitation, disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the Agreement to \nArbitrate, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Agreement to \nArbitrate or any portion of the Agreement to Arbitrate, except that all Disputes regarding",
  "Section 19.B.3 (\"Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief\") including any claim \nthat all or part of that Section is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section \nhas been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an \narbitrator.",
  "arbitrator. \nThe award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Unsatisfied judgments on \nthe arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This User Agreement \nevidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other",
  "provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 \nU.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to \nArbitrate and any arbitration, including the procedures governing Batch Arbitration.",
  "If Informal Dispute Resolution does not resolve satisfactorily within 45 days after receipt of a \nNotice, you and eBay agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute \nthrough binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration &",
  "Mediation (\"NAM\") in accordance with the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules \nand Procedure (the \"NAM Comprehensive Rules\") in effect at the time of arbitration, except \nas supplemented, where applicable, by the NAM Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration",
  "Filings (the \"NAM Mass Filing Rules\"; together with the NAM Comprehensive Rules, the \n\"NAM Rules\"), and as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The NAM Rules are currently \navailable at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/. If NAM is unavailable to",
  "administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or, if the \nparties cannot reach agreement, the court (pursuant to Section 19.C below) shall select the \nadministrator. \nA party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a demand for",
  "arbitration (the \"Demand\"). A Demand to eBay should be sent by mail to eBay Inc., Attn: \nLitigation Department, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020. If eBay initiates an arbitration \nagainst you, it will send a Demand to the physical address we have on file associated with",
  "your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. A \nDemand form is available on NAM's site at \nhttps://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2024/09/Revised-Comprehensive-Demand-for-\nArb-9.17.24.pdf. The Demand must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing",
  "address, e-mail address, and eBay user name of the party seeking arbitration, including a",
  "statement whether the party is a U.S. resident; (2) a statement of the legal claims being \nasserted and the factual bases for those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and \nan accurate, good-faith calculation of the amount in controversy; (4) a statement certifying",
  "completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) a \nstatement certifying that the requesting party will pay any necessary filing fees in connection \nwith such arbitration. If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the",
  "Demand shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email \naddress. Such counsel must also sign the Demand. \nIf you are a U.S. resident, and unless you and eBay otherwise agree, the arbitration, including",
  "any in-person arbitration hearing, will be conducted in the county where you reside or, in the \ncase of Batch Arbitration, as determined by the arbitrator. If you are not a resident of the \nUnited States, then the arbitration, including any in-person arbitration hearing, will be held",
  "in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States, or another mutually agreed location. Subject to the \nNAM Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information \nbetween the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. You and eBay",
  "agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall \nbe kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, \naccountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to",
  "keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential. \nYou and eBay agree that at least 14 days before the date set for an arbitration hearing, any \nparty may serve an offer in writing upon the other party to allow judgment on specified",
  "terms. If the offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party \nfails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover any post-offer costs \nto which they otherwise would be entitled and shall pay the offering party’s costs from the",
  "time of the offer. \nThe parties agree that the arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance \nwith applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of \nprivilege recognized by law. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall not be bound by",
  "rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users but shall be bound by rulings in prior \narbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The \narbitrator's award shall be final and binding, and an unsatisfied judgment on the award",
  "rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. \n5. Arbitrator \nThe arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney and will be selected by the parties \nfrom the NAM’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators, provided that if the Batch Arbitration",
  "process is triggered, NAM will appoint the arbitrator for each batch without soliciting input \nor feedback from any party. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within 35 \ndays of delivery of the Demand, then NAM will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the \nNAM Rules.",
  "NAM Rules. \n6. Fees and Costs \nPayment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the applicable \nNAM fee schedules (the \"Fee Schedules\"), but may be reapportioned between the parties in",
  "accordance with this Agreement to Arbitrate, as follows: if you complied with the Informal \nDispute Resolution requirements in Section 1 of this Agreement and the value of the relief \nsought in the Dispute is $10,000 or less, at your request eBay will pay all filing,",
  "administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. The parties shall bear \ntheir own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the",
  "substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Demand was frivolous or was brought for \nan improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 11(b)). To the extent, following a presentation on the merits, on its own motion or",
  "a party’s, and after affording a reasonable opportunity to respond, an arbitrator determines \nthat a party who commenced arbitration did not bring its claim(s) consistent with counsel’s \nCertification and the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), the",
  "arbitrator may, as part of its award, impose sanctions by ordering that the initiating party \nreimburse the responding party for all arbitration costs and arbitrators’ fees the responding \nparty incurred under the Fee Schedule. \n7. Batch Arbitration",
  "7. Batch Arbitration \nTo increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and eBay \nagree that in the event that there are 25 or more individual Demands of a substantially \nsimilar nature filed against eBay by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law",
  "firms, or organizations (\"Claimant’s Counsel\"), within a reasonably proximate period of time, \nfor example, a 90 day period, NAM shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of \n100 Demands per batch (or, if between 25 and 99 individual Demands are filed, a single",
  "batch of all those Demands, and, to the extent there are less than 100 Demands remaining \nafter the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Demands); (2) \nappoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch on a",
  "consolidated basis with one set of filing and administrative fees due per batch, one \nprocedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be selected by Claimant’s Counsel or, if \nClaimant’s Counsel does not have a preference, by the arbitrator, and one final award, which",
  "will provide for any and all relief to which the arbitrator determines each individual party is \nentitled (\"Batch Arbitration\"). NAM shall administer all batches concurrently, to the extent \npossible. \nAll parties agree that Demands are of a \"substantially similar nature\" if they arise out of or",
  "relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issue(s) and \nseek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the \nBatch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise NAM, and NAM shall appoint a",
  "sole standing Procedural Arbitrator or, should the circumstances so require, an Emergency \nArbitrator, according to the NAM Rules, to determine the applicability of the Batch \nArbitration process (the Procedural Arbitrator or Emergency Arbitrator, the \"Administrative",
  "Arbitrator\"). To expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the \nparties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to \nresolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by eBay.",
  "You and eBay agree to cooperate in good faith with NAM to implement the Batch Arbitration \nprocess including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of \nDemands, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may",
  "include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the \nresolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the \narbitration proceedings. This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as",
  "authorizing a class, collective and/or representative arbitration or action of any kind, except \nas expressly set forth in this provision, and nothing about the Batch Arbitration process will \npreclude any party from participating in any arbitration administered according to that \nprocess.",
  "process. \n8. Severability \nExcept as provided in Section 19.B.3 (\"Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief\"), if",
  "any part or parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than Section 19.B.7 (\"Batch \nArbitration\")) are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part \nor parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the",
  "Agreement to Arbitrate shall continue in full force and effect. However, if Section 19.B.7 \n(\"Batch Arbitration\") of this Agreement to Arbitrate is found under the law to be invalid or \nunenforceable then, in that case, the entire Agreement to Arbitrate shall be void, and the",
  "parties agree that all Disputes will be heard in the state or federal courts located in Salt Lake \nCounty, Utah as required in Section 19.C. You further agree that any Dispute that you have \nwith eBay as detailed in this Agreement to Arbitrate must be initiated within the applicable",
  "statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, \nyou agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same \nmanner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent \njurisdiction.",
